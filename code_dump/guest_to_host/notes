Create a tap device on the guest and connect it to the tap device on the host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< Tested on CentOS9 >>

# create tap device on the host ans assign IP address
ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap
ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1/30
ifconfig tap0 up (only if the interface is not up)

# create tap device on guest
-netdev tap,id=mytap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no
-device virtio-net,netdev=mytap,mac="52:54:00:02:d9:01"

# configure tap device inside the guest
-- When the VM is started, it will take a while to load since it will dry to
assign an IP address for the tap device using DHCP. Since there is no dhcp server
it will keep hunting and after some timeout and then start the gnome desktop
-- From inside the VM, network settings of the tap interface
    - disable IPv4
    - disable IPv6
    - restart the tap interface
-- after this, on subsequent reboot, the guest will not try to assign ip address
